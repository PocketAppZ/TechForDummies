* Solution
* Goto Xampp/mysql
* Rename data to old_data
* Make a copy of the folder called "backup". which is present in the same directory and paste it in the same directory.
* Now rename the copy of the original backup folder as "data"
* Now go to "old_data" and copy only the project that you are working on for example "era_wanderer" folder..
* And paste it in the "data" folder.
* Now delete "ibdata1" file from the "data" folder and then copy the "ibdata1" file from the "old_data" and paste it in the "data" folder.
