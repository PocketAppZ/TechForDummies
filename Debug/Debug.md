## Tips to debug an issue in your code
* Check the application flow. example: `register.html` submits the data to `register.php` and `register.php` stores the data in the mysql under `dbname.tablename`   
* Check the logs. example: `server.log` or `application.log` (if the logs are irrevelant then add statements like `JS:console.log` or `JAVA:System.out.println` to debug where it is causing an issue.
* Check if all the required applications are up and running. example: If you are working with php then check if php is installed and if you are using mysql check if it is installed and running.
* Check if the resources for your project exists in the path that your code is pointing towards.
* If you are working on a compile based programming language, Then make sure you compile it first as most of the bugs can be found during the compile time itself.
 
## Additional Tips
* Take a walk outside.
* Get a coffee break.
* Do something else.

* Do what you love.
